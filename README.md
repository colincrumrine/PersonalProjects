Repo for whatever I work on in my spare time

Current plans for this repo include:

CollatzData Project - I've been getting into recreational math lately, and my newest interest is the Collatz Conjecture.
The CollatzData Project is a program I plan on adding features to slowly but surely, in hopes of making a simple tool that will
allow aspiring mathematicians to find useful patterns and data sets that will help them to either prove or disprove the 
Collatz Conjecture. As stated the program will be simple and will run in your CL. I'm currently using IntelliJ to work on the project,
and I'd highly recommend anyone who wants to add to the program to use the same.
